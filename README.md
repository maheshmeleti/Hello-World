# Hello-World
hi,
  this is Uma Maheswara Rao, I am studying Electronics And Communications Engineering(ECE) in Rajiv Gandhi University of Knowledge Technologies, Nuzvid. Even though I am from ECE, a mini project done in the course work ignited interest in Computer Science. I started learning how to code. I learnt MatLab, python3 by myself and learning java and other programming languages.
